    <p>Joshua.I's Freelance Services Privacy Policy</p>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 27, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how I
      collect, use, and protect your information when you use my website.
    </p>

    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This website does not have a contact form or account system that stores
      your information. The only way to contact me is by using a direct email
      link (e.g., clicking an ‚ÄúEmail Me‚Äù button), which opens your own email
      client. When you email me directly, your email address and message are
      handled entirely through your chosen email service and my email inbox.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to send me an email, I will only use the information you
      provide (such as your name, email address, and message) to respond to your
      inquiry. I do not share, sell, or use your information for marketing
      purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>How Your Information Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
      Because this site does not store form submissions, no personal information
      is stored on the website itself. Any information you send by email remains
      in my email account and is protected by the security measures of my email
      provider. Please avoid sending sensitive personal information in your
      email.
    </p>

    <h2>Third‚ÄëParty Services</h2>
    <p>
      While this website itself does not send your data to any third-party
      services, I may use trusted third-party software to support my freelance
      business operations. These may include tools for invoicing and accounting
      (e.g., Wave), digital product delivery (e.g., Gumroad), file sharing
      (e.g., Google Drive), or communication (e.g., Gmail).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any personal information you share when interacting with me through these
      services is subject to their individual privacy policies. I only use
      reputable platforms that follow standard security practices, but I
      encourage you to review their privacy terms if you have concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You may request that I delete or correct any personal information I hold
      about you, except where I am required to keep certain information for
      legal, tax, or legitimate business record‚Äëkeeping purposes.
      <script>
        document.write(getEmailLink());
      </script>
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be
      reflected on this page with a new ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your
      information is handled, please contact me at <br />
